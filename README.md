Threat Intel 


This is a collection of Threat Intel with APTs, Tools, Etc. of potential threat targeting Oil and Gas sectors. 
I like looking at the Obsidian map for quick connections between potential APTs> Country> Sector> Tools
By no means is this 100% correct attribution, this is my own personal notes with some articles pointed to OSINT findings.
